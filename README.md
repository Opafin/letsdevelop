# letsdevelop

This is a webpage to present a practice C# Game project.
See the associated Github Page and play the game at. https://opafin.github.io/website_letsdevelop/

The C# code is in the csharp_practicegit at https://github.com/opafin/csharp_practicegit

The page is based on a free Jekyll Theme by the generous Emil Baehr. In addition to the markdown, I've also heavily modified the HTML, CSS and JS to
Present a WebGL Unity build.

More info on the Jekyll Theme in "JekyllTheme" in the repository.
